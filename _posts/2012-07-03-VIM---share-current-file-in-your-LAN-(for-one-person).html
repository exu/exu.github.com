Inspired by <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/103603507868093099204/posts/E69PHmXwubH">César Bustíos Benites</a> I've made nice VIM key map to share my current file using NetCat tool.<br />
<br />
<pre class="brush:bash">map &lt;Leader&gt;= :!cat % \| nc -l 5555 &amp;&lt;CR&gt;:let @+='http://10.0.0.89:5555'&lt;CR&gt;
</pre>
<br />
You can change port and IP address to your own. Now I'm pressing ,= followed by (my leader is ",") and Ctr-V (Shift-Ins) into my friend IM window :) (Of course everything in LAN)<br />
<br />
What above nc command do?<br />
Echoing file content and pipe it to nc which listen on given port and if connection from client begins netcat returns piped content to client, that's all.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JacekWysocki/~4/79JGX0pyn6U" height="1" width="1"/>
